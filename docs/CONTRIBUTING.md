## :bug: I Found a Bug

Sorry! It happens to the best of us. If you've found a bug in vendify-sdk SDK, **please [search](https://github.com/the-berufegoru/vendify-sdk/issues/) to see if it's already been reported**. Otherwise, create a [new issue](https://github.com/the-berufegoru/vendify-sdk/issues/new). If you can fix the bug yourself, feel free to create a [pull request](#propose-a-change) thereafter.

Please include _as much detail as possible_ to help us reproduce and diagnose the bug. Most importantly:

- Include your test code or file(s). If large, please provide a link to a repository or [gist](https://gist.github.com).
- Please show code in JavaScript only (any version)

If we need more information from you, we'll let you know. If you don't within a reasonable time frame (TBD), your issue will be automatically closed for inactivity.

## :exclamation: Propose a Change

Before you get your hands dirty, please [search](https://github.com/the-berufegoru/vendify-sdk/issues/) for a related issue, or [create a new one](https://github.com/the-berufegoru/vendify-sdk/issues/new). If you wish to contribute a new feature, this is doubly important! Let's discuss your proposed changes first; we don't want you to waste time implementing a change that is at odds with the project's direction. That said, we'll happily consider any contribution, no matter how great or small.

Follow these steps to get going. If you are having trouble, don't be afraid to [ask for help](#got-a-question).

> PRO TIP: After `npm install`, run `npm start` to start the API

1. [Install Node.js 16 LTS or newer with npm@7+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
   - If you're new to installing Node, a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) can help you manage multiple version installations.
   - You will need [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) to run browser-based tests locally.
1. Follow [Github's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on setting up Git, forking and cloning.
1. Create a new branch in your working copy. Give your branch a descriptive name, such as `issue/12345`: `git checkout -b issue/12345`.
1. Execute `npm install` to install the development dependencies.
   - Do not use `yarn install`.
   - Some optional dependencies may fail; you can safely ignore these unless you are trying to build the documentation.
   - If you're sick of seeing the failures, run `npm install --ignore-scripts`.
